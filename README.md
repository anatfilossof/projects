## About this project

In this project, I analyzed the results of an A/B test that highlights key products in the food and drink category as a banner at the top of the website of an e-commerce company named GloBox. GloBox is an online marketplace specializing in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world. Their food and drink offerings have experienced significant growth in recent months, prompting the company to raise awareness of this product category for revenue increasement.

The project encompasses three stages:

1. Extract the user-level aggregated dataset using SQL.
2. Analyze the A/B test results using statistical methods in spreadsheets and visualizations in Tableau.
3. Create a written report of the A/B test results and provide a recommendation to stakeholders on whether GloBox should launch the experience to all users.


The additional two files include:
* A comprehensive written report of the A/B test analysis results with recommendations and conclusions.
* A storytelling presentation that communicates the high-level results along with my data-driven recommendations and conclusions to non-technical stakeholders.
